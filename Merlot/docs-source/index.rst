Welcome to Merlot's documentation!
==================================

Merlot is a web-based project management software written in Python using the
`Grok <http://grok.zope.org>`_ web development framework.

Merlot is under development, but it currently allows you to:

* Create projects and organize projects in tasks
* Associate projects to clients
* Manage projects and tasks statuses
* Track the time worked in tasks and generate reports based on time logs
* Have a set of favorite tasks on a per user basis
* Quickly log time in a task via the `quick log feature`

Currently, the best way to get your own Merlot instance up and running is by
following the instructions in the :ref:`dev-getting-started` guide.

The project is hosted in Google Code at: http://code.google.com/p/merlot/.
There you will find screenshots, links to the issue tracker, mailing list and
other resources.
